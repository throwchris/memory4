            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">1</span> And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, 
            and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text" onclick="toggleTextColor()">stars</span>:
            
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">2</span> And she being with child 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text2" onclick="toggleTextColor2()">cried</span>, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">3</span> And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text3" onclick="toggleTextColor3()">red</span> dragon, 
            having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">4</span> And his tail drew the 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text4" onclick="toggleTextColor4()">third</span> part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: 
            and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">5</span> And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text5" onclick="toggleTextColor5()">all</span> nations with a rod of iron: and 
            her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">6</span> And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they 
            should feed her there a thousand two hundred and <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text6" onclick="toggleTextColor6()">threescore</span> days.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">7</span> And there was war in heaven: 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text7" onclick="toggleTextColor7()">Michael</span> and his angels fought 
            against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">8</span>And prevailed not; neither was their 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text8" onclick="toggleTextColor8()">place</span> found any more in heaven. 
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">9</span> And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text9" onclick="toggleTextColor9()">deceiveth</span> the 
            whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">10</span> And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text10" onclick="toggleTextColor10()">strength</span>, and the kingdom of our God, 
            and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">11</span> And they 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text11" onclick="toggleTextColor11()">overcame</span> him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they 
            loved not their lives unto the death.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">12</span> Therefore 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text12" onclick="toggleTextColor12()">rejoice</span>, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! 
            for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">13</span> And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text13" onclick="toggleTextColor13()">woman</span> which brought forth the man child.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">14</span> And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, 
            where she is <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text14" onclick="toggleTextColor14()">nourished</span> for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">15</span> And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text15" onclick="toggleTextColor15()">flood</span> after the woman, that he might cause her to be 
            carried away of the flood.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">16</span> And the earth 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text16" onclick="toggleTextColor16()">helped</span> the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which 
            the dragon cast out of his mouth.
            

            <span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: small;">17</span> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the 
            <span class="w3-text-light-grey" id="text17" onclick="toggleTextColor17()">commandments</span> of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
